# Progress Log - Garage Sale Organizer

## Session: August 11, 2025

### Initial Issue: File Upload Timeouts
**Problem:** File uploads were failing with timeout errors during image upload with AI processing.

**Root Causes:**
1. Frontend axios timeout too short (30 seconds)
2. Backend request timeouts insufficient for AI processing
3. No progress indicators for user feedback

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Timeout Configuration ‚úÖ
- **Frontend:** Increased axios timeout to 2 minutes (general), 3 minutes for image uploads
- **Backend:** Added dynamic timeout handling - 3 minutes for `/images` routes
- **Request Limits:** Added 50MB request size limits for large images

#### 2. Progress Tracking System ‚úÖ
**Enhanced Upload Progress:**
- Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
- Granular status messages:
  - "Uploading image..." (0-50%)
  - "Processing image..." (50-55%)
  - "AI analyzing image..." (55-75%)
  - "Generating title..." (75-85%)
  - "Creating description..." (85-95%)
  - "Estimating price..." (95-100%)

**Visual Improvements:**
- Smooth progress bar animation
- Animated bouncing dots during AI processing
- Real-time percentage display
- Status-specific messages

#### 3. Backend Logging Enhancement ‚úÖ
**Comprehensive Upload Logging:**
```
[UPLOAD] Starting image upload for item {id}
[UPLOAD] File received: {filename}, size: {size}MB
[UPLOAD] Verifying item exists...
[UPLOAD] Creating thumbnail... (with timing)
[UPLOAD] Starting AI analysis...
[UPLOAD] AI analysis completed in {time}ms
[UPLOAD] Upload completed successfully in {total_time}ms
```

**Error Handling:**
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
- File cleanup on failed uploads
- Graceful degradation when AI fails

#### 4. AI Model Update ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Using deprecated `gpt-4-vision-preview` model
**Solution:**
- Updated code default to `gpt-4o`
- Updated database setting from deprecated model
- Restarted servers to pick up new configuration

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Frontend Changes:
1. **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`**
   - Added progress callback support
   - Implemented staged progress simulation
   - Increased upload timeout to 3 minutes

2. **`frontend/src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`**
   - Added progress bar with percentage
   - Dynamic status messages
   - Animated loading indicators

3. **`frontend/src/pages/CreateItemPage.tsx`**
   - Integrated progress tracking
   - Added upload state management
   - Enhanced error handling

4. **`frontend/src/hooks/useItems.ts`**
   - Updated mutation to support progress callbacks

#### Backend Changes:
1. **`backend/server.js`**
   - Added comprehensive upload logging
   - Implemented dynamic request timeouts
   - Enhanced error handling and cleanup

2. **`backend/ai-service.js`**
   - Updated default model to `gpt-4o`

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- File upload with progress tracking
- Thumbnail generation
- Detailed server-side logging
- Enhanced user experience with progress indicators

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing:
- AI analysis with updated `gpt-4o` model
- Form auto-filling after successful AI analysis
- Blue "AI Analysis Complete" notification

#### üîß Next Steps:
1. Test image upload with new progress system
2. Verify AI analysis works with `gpt-4o` model
3. Confirm form fields auto-populate with AI suggestions
4. Test error handling scenarios

### Architecture Notes

**Upload Flow:**
1. User selects image ‚Üí Progress starts at 0%
2. File upload begins ‚Üí Real-time upload progress (0-50%)
3. Server receives file ‚Üí Creates thumbnail
4. AI analysis starts ‚Üí Progress continues (50-100%) with status updates
5. AI generates suggestions ‚Üí Form fields auto-populate
6. Success notification ‚Üí Progress completes

**Error Handling:**
- Network timeouts: Extended to 3 minutes
- AI failures: Graceful degradation, upload still succeeds
- File cleanup: Automatic cleanup on errors
- User feedback: Clear error messages

### Configuration Updates

**Database Settings:**
```javascript
openai_model: "gpt-4o" // Updated from "gpt-4-vision-preview"
```

**Timeout Settings:**
```javascript
// Frontend
axios.timeout: 120000 // 2 minutes general
upload.timeout: 180000 // 3 minutes for images

// Backend
request.timeout: 180000 // 3 minutes for /images routes
```
